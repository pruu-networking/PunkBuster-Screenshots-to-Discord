Reporting Bugs
--------------

This bit of information is here to guide you through the process of creating a bug report for our project! Issues cannot
only be used for developers to track bugs, but they can also track enhancements and tasks. The more detailed your report
is, the easier it is for developers to reproduce and resolve the bug!

### Did you find a bug? :bug:

* **Ensure the bug is not coming from a customization** within your files!
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/pruu-networking/PunkBuster-Screenshots-to-Discord/issues). If the same issue exists,
  feel free to leave a comment and tell us you are experiencing the issue as well and if possible add some additional or
  missing information!
* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/pruu-networking/PunkBuster-Screenshots-to-Discord/issues/new)!

#### Submit A Bug Report :inbox_tray:

There are several things that go into making a bug report a good bug report!

This is a breakdown of a generic Issue:

* **Title** should give some general insight as to what the bug is about.
* **Description** should give greater detail of the bug that cannot be explained in the **Title**.
* **Labels** are colored to represent a category they fall into.
* **Milestones** are what developers use to group tasks together and quickly evaluate how close the project deliverable
  is near completion.
* **Assignees** are developers who are directly linked to resolve the issue.
* **Comments** allow other members to give feedback on the issue.

#### What are some good details to provide in a bug report? :pencil2:

When describing your Issue through the **Description** area, it is recommended that you provide as much information as
possible to resolve the Issue as fast as possible. Keep in mind that you can tag people within the **Description** area
through the `@mention` feature. You can also tag other Issues or Pull Requests by typing `#` which will pull up a list
of issues. You can find a markdown guide
at [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Some information to keep in mind while creating an Issue:

* **GitHub Hash**: The hash is a 40 alphanumeric string (which can be broken down to the first 7 characters) which
  states the version you are at. (**If you are using SVN instead of Git:** Please also put the change date and first
  line of the commit message beside the revision number, or we will not be able to look up the corresponding Git hash).
* **Client Date**: The client date provides specific details depending on the issue. The main detail is that it helps
  narrow down issues that are related to a packet problem.
* **Modifications that may affect results**: It is always best to try to reproduce your issue on a clean code if you
  have lots of modifications.
* **Description of Issue**: Describe your issue in detail! Screenshots and videos help a lot! Please also provide crash
  dumps if one of the servers is crashing.
* **How to Reproduce Issue**: Describe how to reproduce your issue in detail! The more, the merrier!

Suggesting Enhancements
-----------------------

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? :bookmark_tabs:

* Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one? :bulb:

* Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the feature addition or changes.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what the addition or changes are for. Include the relevant issue number if
  applicable.

#### How to create Pull Requests :pencil:

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. Next, you will need to [fork our project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository)
   to your account.
3. Before making changes, make sure
   you [create a new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
   for your working tree.
4. After completing your changes, commit and push it to your branch.
5. Now you are ready to [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for our
   PunkBuster-Screenshots project!

* Upon creating the Pull Request, make sure you follow
  our [template](https://github.com/pruu-networking/PunkBuster-Screenshots-to-Discord/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
  and provide the required information.
* **OPTIONAL**: We would greatly appreciate those that check the box
  to [allow edits by maintainers](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/),
  so we can apply small cleanups or additions to your changes before merging them!

Thanks!
